# poisson-log-gaussian-solver
Propose an new MCMC algorithm to do inference on the parameters of a Poisson log-Gaussian model. Note that a Poisson log-Gaussian is a multivariate count distribution with Poisson log-normal being its univariate version. The proposed algorithm is especially useful for sparse count data where traditional MCMC will fail.
